Impasse-HTML5
=============
Impasse is a challenging puzzle game. Its self-explaining, has simple Graphics and is all around fun to play.

Impasse was originally made by Wanderlands written in flash. In order to learn HTML5 and to show my admiration for this game i wrote in a two day tunnel-coding session clone in HTML5.

The final result contains the screen made with the new canvas element, sounds and all levels and functionality of the original game. The code is written in JavaScript.

Impasse HTML5 showed me that i’m capable of focusing on something i’m really interested in for more than 12 hours a day. Including the research on the new technologies i needed two days for this project.
